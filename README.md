# E-Learning Student Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a sample student e-learning dataset to explore student performance in online courses. It includes basic data analysis, cleaning, visualizations, and an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit.

The project is adapted from a beginner-level data analysis assignment originally designed for the CORD-19 research dataset.
